The two brothers have not seen each other for nearly twenty years, since Choon Bo gave his youngest son, Yeong Goo, to Man Bo because he wanted a son.

He has emerged as one ultimately after undergoing a lifelong process. Drama \"Yi Sun-shin\" is designed to challenge the fixed ideas about him who has been remembered in the form of an imposing statue standing at the Gwanghwamun intersection in Seoul and the Hyeonchungsa Shrine in South Chungcheong Province, while shedding a new light upon him as a human being.2) Drama \"Yi Sun-shin\" depicts Yi Sun-shin as a soldier who struggled to survive turbulent days.At the time when Yi Sun-shin lived, the Joseon Dynasty had to achieve political reforms and stabilize the livelihood of the people, while defending the country against the Yojin (Nu Zhen) Tribe and Japanese pirate raiders. Yi Sun-shin was regarded sometimes with jealousy in the process of protecting grass-roots people and sticking to the principles of reforms and lost some battles. He was removed from his duties three times and reinstated to the military service two times as a rank-and-filer. But for all this disgrace, Yi Sun-shin was reborn as a true hero who led the Joseon Navy to a myth of invincibility during the Hideyoshi Invasion (1592-1598 A.D.). Yi Sun-shin, as a soldier who struggled to protect grass-roots people, is what Drama \"Yi Sun-shin\" has planned to depict.3) Drama \"Yi Sun-shin\" is a Korean version of \"War and Peace\" in the 21st centuryDrama \"Yi Sun-shin\" is not a biography of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, nor does it intend to reconstruct a part of the Joseon Dynasty that existed in the 16th century. It will merely look into many human beings, including Yi Sun-shin, who underwent an extreme situation called the Hideyoshi Invasion, in efforts to study all kinds of human nature, from the most noble down to the most crude...While dramatizing a war in which human beings turn into inhuman wretches in an extreme way, we hope that this drama will serve paradoxically as an opportunity to remind people of the importance of peace.4) We are not going to depict characters based on a dichotomous criterion.We will cast a new light on another military leader, Won Gyun, whose evaluation has been severely distorted in the process of making a hero of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, and maintain an objective view of the military leaders of Japan and the Chinese Ming Dynasty as well. While based on a historical fact on the national hero of Japan, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, we are going to find out how his distorted ambition had led many people to be killed in the war and laid a stumbling block to the peace in East Asia. We will remain neutral in our evaluations of Ming generals, such as Chen Lin and Li Rusong.5) We have made an attempt to shed a new light on numerous officers and soldiers under Yi Sun-shin\'s command by looking into the admiral not as a hero, but as a true leader.Yi Sun-shin had a staff of many talented officers under his command. Some of them include Kwon Jun, a strategist, Na Dae-yong, a scientist, and many nameless people who assisted Na in building the turtle ships and making armory. Besides, many other officers, including Chung Un, fought in the war, setting their own life at naught. The drama will describe Yi Sun-shin, a man of virtues, as the leader of these men.6) In part, the drama will shed light on the life of the villagers at \"Gonyang Pottery\" in a bid to emphasize the superiority of the culture of the Joseon Dynasty.The Japanese were so enthusiastic about the Joseon culture that the Hideyoshi Invasion was called a war of porcelain bowls. Many Joseon potters were taken as prisoners of war to Japan, where they produced china and porcelain that later formed the basis of the economic power of the shogunate government of Ieyasu Tokugawa in Edo, Japan. The drama is going to lay stress on the superiority of the Joseon culture by depicting the life and conflicts of potters at the Gonyang Pottery Village.In such turbulent days, the king, senior government officials or military leaders were not the only ones that were concerned about the future of their country. There were merchants, who did not hesitate to donate their purses to the national defense despite the cold treatment they received in society based on social status; numerous army volunteers and their leaders, who tried to save their country with their own life; and monk soldiers and their leaders, who rose in arms in the belief that real redemption would come from saving the country. While depicting their resolute stance, we are going to reaffirm the stark fact that \"grass-roots people are the real heroes of history.\"8) We will try to shed light on the history from an objective point of view, while also taking a look at the background of a historical view that was instigated by the Japanese colonial government.Some historians, including Lee Gwang-su, who have been advocates of such a distorted historical view, have tried to attribute the outbreak of the war and the subsequent defeat to the government officials\' preoccupation in political strifes. But this view is obviously a misjudgment. Political contests are not a prelude to the national ruin. The Joseon society, which was an absolute monarchy, was not ready yet to receive such a political system.9) This drama will draw a real picture of the Joseon society, which was not well acquainted with the international situation at the time, in a bid to learn a lesson from this example.In East Asia at the time, Ming was losing his influence gradually, while Yojin was emerging as the central power in Manchuria. In Japan, Nobunaga Oda died after putting an end to a 120-year civil war, and Hideyoshi Toyotomi took power and unified the entire Japan. During the civil war, Japan accepted the Western civilization and came in contact with quite a new weapon, harquebuses. Records have it that the military capabilities of Japan at the time were stronger than those of the European countries combined. Japan had the high ambition to conquer East Asia based on such military capabilities. Regrettably, there were not many people in Joseon who had a correct understanding of the international situation.The drama will point out, first of all, these points as the primary causes of the 7-year Joseon-Japanese War and the ensuing bitter defeat. We are going to look into the life of Yi Sun-shin, Yu Seong-ryong and Won Gyun who went through such turbulent days as contemporaries. From this history, we are going to learn a lesson for today\'s Korea, a small and weak nation in the dynamics of the international relations.Source: KBS',0,0),

What happened was the subsequent massacre of hundreds of innocent people.

The police always expect to swiftly solve cases. As crime scene detectives try to measure up to those expectations, they occasionally jump to wrong conclusions. Thus, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police\'s First Investigative Division set up the Evidence Verification Section and gave it the important task of validating cases that have been closed within a limited time in order to prevent wrongful convictions from happening as a result of out of control investigators at crime scenes. But its actual job is to correct typographical errors and omissions and stamp investigation reports with the words \'verification completed\', and then send it over to public prosecutors. The members of the section headed by a veteran detective who worked his way up and has lost passion for his work, are a little idiosyncratic and somewhat difficult. It is merely a titular section meant to call the attention of the public to the fairness of the police. Deputy Inspector Shinkai Akira (Mizuki Arisa), a career elite who has been sidelined as a result of some incident, is assigned to be the new leader of the Evidence Verification Section. A sharp-minded female who gives the impression of an eccentric person, Akira breaks away from the bureaucratic work and genuinely starts to validate evidence, demonstrating her ability to take action and sense of justice in order to rally her disillusioned subordinates. Discovering new facts from small doubts in the reports, she overturns cases that should have been solved and finds the true criminals. -- Jdrama Weblog',0,0),

His mother was a national player and she personally coached him and honed his skills as a table tennis player. However, ever since his mother\'s untimely death in an accident, Ah Wu became quiet and sullen and withdrew into his own shell. His performance in his studies and at work was affected and he was branded a â€œloserâ€�. Ah Wu helps out at his father, He Yingxiong\'s (Zheng Ge Ping) laundry shop. His only comfort is in paddling a table tennis ball against a wall.He Yingxiong is furious that his son is seemingly useless and wasting his life away paddling a table tennis ball against an empty wall on most days.

Even though Ah Wu does not have any actual experience playing against a real opponent, and in fact could not even beat a young child at a game of table tennis, he possesses an innate talent for reading his opponent\'s moves and strategy in the game. This enables him to be the dark horse in some matches, coming back from the brink of defeat to win the game.Ah Wu is a loner and his only friend is Mai Xiaofen (Teresa Tseng) whom he grew up with. Xiaofen is one of the top female table tennis players and her mother, ex-national player Mai Tiantian (Kym Ng), is her coach who pushes her hard to train herself to become a top player in the sport. However, Xiaofen lacks confidence. Since she started to play competitively, her personal best has always remained at fourth placing.

Ah Wu is undeterred as he loves table tennis. He tells himself that he will stop playing against an empty wall but instead, will step up to play against other table tennis players.Ah Wu\'s luck turns for the better when his talent is spotted by the undisputed â€œKing of Table Tennisâ€�, Lin Dadi (Zhang Wen Xiang) who is determined to train Ah Wu to become a world-class player.
